# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and push your code:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "langgraph-mcp-agent-twitter")
4. Add a description: "A LangGraph-based agent for creating, minting, registering IP assets with Story Protocol, and automatically posting about them on Twitter."
5. Choose whether to make the repository public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/ellieli/CascadeProjects/langgraph-mcp-agent

# Add the remote repository URL (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/langgraph-mcp-agent-twitter.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify your repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and commits in the repository
3. The README.md will be displayed on the repository's main page

## 4. Share your repository

Now you can share the URL of your GitHub repository with others so they can see the improvements you've made to the original repository.

## Key Improvements Highlighted

The repository showcases these key improvements over the original:

1. **Twitter Integration**: Automatic posting of newly minted IP assets to Twitter
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Streamlined workflow with better error handling
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for setup and usage
4. **Blockchain Explorer Links**: Direct links to view assets on Story Protocol Explorer and StoryScan
